One study showed that (in middle-aged Finnish men) using the sauna 4-7x a week decreased all-cause mortality by a whopping 40% versus 1x a week.1 If you want the most bang for your buck, the best effective dose of sauna usage (that has been rigorously researched) is 15-20 minutes at 180¬∞F around 4-5 times a week ‚Äî you just want to make sure you get a nice sweat going.</description></item><item><title>Digital Garden &amp; Second Brain</title><link>https://nikhilthota.com/projects/brain/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nikhilthota.com/projects/brain/</guid><description>&amp;hellip;</description></item><item><title>Monitoring my Blood Sugar as a Non-Diabetic</title><link>https://nikhilthota.com/writing/cgm/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nikhilthota.com/writing/cgm/</guid><description>As I get older, I find myself continuing to optimize my health under the guidance of one core principle ‚Äî that most of the negativity I experience externally is caused by internal biological factors (poor sleep, blood sugar crash, nutrient deficiency, etc.)

Our first few days in Kona were standard. We got some morning coffee, I rolled into work at 7am, grinded out some code, and clocked out by 3pm. The evenings were filled with walks, historic sites (more on hawaiian history here), and sunsets by the small beach near our Airbnb known as &amp;ldquo;Keiki Beach Queen&amp;rsquo;s Bath&amp;rdquo;.
By merging the energies of work and life in this way, I&amp;rsquo;ve realized that I genuinely enjoy working on meaningful projects while on vacation.</description></item><item><title>S03 E01: 'A Lightweight Wrapper'</title><link>https://nikhilthota.com/letters/sep-21/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nikhilthota.com/letters/sep-21/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Facing Fears in Big Island</title><link>https://nikhilthota.com/writing/fears/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nikhilthota.com/writing/fears/</guid><description>If you‚Äôd like to skip straight to my recommendations, please click here.

One of the solutions was to create a suite of safety products while transcating on Marketplace, including sharable meetup plans, a safety check-in, live location sharing, and other tools.</description></item><item><title>Aquatic Confessions</title><link>https://nikhilthota.com/notes/water-1/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nikhilthota.com/notes/water-1/</guid><description>This was originally posted on my newsletter.

This past month, I&amp;rsquo;ve been chowing down on globs of spirulina, chlorella, and other nutritious micro-algae every day. I&amp;rsquo;m sane I swear ‚Äî these algae are some of the most dense and bioavailable sources of protein &amp;amp; nutrients available. There is also some promising research showing that they might protect the brain and improve metabolic function.

One of the great ironies of life is that when you achieve something you&amp;rsquo;ve been working towards (e.g. get from point A to point B), you often feel empty and restless afterwards. It&amp;rsquo;s partially because of a post-dopamine release of prolactin, and partially because of an assumption that getting to B will solve your problems. The reality is that you ought to find a new B soon, or the lack of self-imposed structure will eat away at you.</description></item><item><title>S02 E01: Zen and The Art of Software Engineering</title><link>https://nikhilthota.com/letters/mar-21/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nikhilthota.com/letters/mar-21/</guid><description/></item><item><title>S01 E04: The Mile (and .56) High Town</title><link>https://nikhilthota.com/letters/feb-21/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nikhilthota.com/letters/feb-21/</guid><description/></item><item><title>The Discomfort Index</title><link>https://nikhilthota.com/notes/discomfort/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nikhilthota.com/notes/discomfort/</guid><description>This is an experiment.
