<a href=%22http://www.tylerjrichards.com/%22>Tyler Richards</a> and I were having a conversation about journaling. I told him that I had over 4 <em>years</em> worth of consistent journal entries and Tyler, being the data-minded person he is, gave me an idea to reinforce the lessons and insights from these journaling sessions.</p><p><strong>The Idea</strong>: A system that emails me a random journal entry every day so I could see exactly what was going on in my mind at that given time.</p><p><strong>The Data</strong>: 600+ journal entries with content length ranging from cool 1-liners to 3 pages of word vomit</p><p>My journal entries are very free-form and stream-of-consciousness so I’m not totally sure if I’ll end up learning anything useful, but I was curious to find out. The first step? Create a database to hold all of my journal entries.</p><h2 id=1-creating-the-database>1. Creating the Database</h2><p>Holding all of my entries in a way that could be easily & efficiently accessed while also providing me the flexibility to add new entries if needed, SQLite was the tool for the job. This
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pd-0G0MigUA" target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">tutorial</a> provides a good introduction to understanding how to create and query a local SQLite database with Python.</p><script type=application/javascript src=https://gist.github.com/nt92/e3f48d3532ee9c1496a65e66e44dd1dd.js></script><p><em>Simple 6 lines to create a local database in Python</em></p><h2 id=2-convert-my-google-doc-files-into-usable-data>2. Convert my Google Doc files into usable data</h2><p>The next step was aggregating all of my Google Doc files so that I could go through all of them with a script to extract all entries. Thankfully, I had some semblance of organization with which I separated entries — before each entry, I have a date. Sometimes it’s <em>mm/dd/yy</em>, sometimes <em>dd/mm/yy</em> if I thought I was cool for being in Europe, but there was always a date.</p><p>Once I had all of my files in a folder, I had to figure out how to go through each file and extract every entry. After reading this lovely
<a href=https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-extract-data-from-ms-word-documents-using-python-ed3fbb48c122 target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">post</a>, I decided to go with the
<a href=https://python-docx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">docx</a> Python library to read each file paragraph-by-paragraph and create a new entry in my database every time I ran into a new date.</p><script type=application/javascript src=https://gist.github.com/nt92/3886577b104b5c41e5edbf9de86cf421.js></script><p><em>This shows how I am going through each file and extracting every individual entry based on whether I run into a pattern matching my date formats</em></p><h2 id=3-send-out-a-random-entry-every-day>3. Send out a random entry every day</h2><p>The next step was figuring how to send myself an email with an entry that was fetched from the database created earlier. This
<a href=https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/code-snippets-source-code/using-python-to-send-email/ target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">guide</a> went through that process, which is surprisingly easy!</p><script type=application/javascript src=https://gist.github.com/nt92/26f5e4a31f738a89f6304f1f17cf77f3.js></script><p>The final step was scheduling a recurring task that would run this code every morning automatically. Thankfully, Mac has a built-in system for this called

This was fixed by waking my laptop a minute before the 10am slot when the job was scheduled to run, detailed

So what now? I’m going to spend the next couple of months reading a random journal entry daily while traveling to see if I can glean any unique insights from my ramblings.</p><p>See you on the other side and stay tuned for my analysis 🤙🏽</p><p>My full code can be found
