Before we get into it, here are a few <em>meta</em> housekeeping things.</p><ul><li>I&rsquo;m adding season & episode numbers. I was inspired by
<a href=https://www.robinsloan.com/notes/newsletter-seasons/ target=_self rel="noreferrer noopener">this article</a>, which argues that the metaphor of the season (1) provides the newsletter a sense of <em>going somewhere,</em> (2) gives me the option to pause & reflect between seasons, and (3) affords me the flexibility to evolve the newsletter in a structured way.</li><li>I also realized that I don&rsquo;t need to publish exactly on the first day of the month. I&rsquo;ll make sure the monthly cadence is maintained, but there&rsquo;s no need to be so precise with the timing.</li></ul><h2 id=-personal-update>üó∫ Personal Update</h2><p>I&rsquo;ve spent the past 6 weeks with my family in Florida. As I send this out, I&rsquo;m en route to San Francisco. I&rsquo;m spending the next few weeks there, getting situated into my new apartment (The Precita Pad?), and then am hopefully heading to Hawaii. <em>More on that next month</em>&mldr;</p><h2 id=-artifacts>üé® Artifacts</h2><p>I wrote a
<a href=https://nikhilthota.com/writing/fasting/ target=_self rel="noreferrer noopener">piece</a> blending the science of fasting with my experience doing a 72 hour fast. It&rsquo;s useful for anyone hoping to try fasting and has some&mldr; entertaining drawings.</p><p>I recently read
<a href=https://sive.rs/n target=_self rel="noreferrer noopener">Hell Yeah or No</a> by Derek Sivers and wrote a
<a href=https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3463642689 target=_self rel="noreferrer noopener">Goodreads review</a> and a
<a href=https://twitter.com/nikhilthota/status/1341877666161541120 target=_self rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter thread</a> about it. Overall it&rsquo;s entertaining, short, and inspiring ‚Äî highly recommend.</p><p>Finally, I gave a <em>brown bag</em> talk to my coworkers on the wonders of ergonomics. The video of the presentation is behind a corporate firewall, but here&rsquo;s a
<a href=https://twitter.com/nikhilthota/status/1344298593814007809 target=_self rel="noreferrer noopener">thread</a> summarizing my favorite ideas and some actionable steps.</p><h2 id=-life-reflections>üåä Life Reflections</h2><p>I have a 9 year old sister. One of the main reasons I choose to spend months with family is to be there as she grows up. It&rsquo;s been a joy watching her develop a personality of her own and soak up my unfortunate mannerisms. As she gets older, I&rsquo;ve noticed my parents push her to be more <em>grown up</em> ‚Äî to them, this means being more responsible and aware of the world around her.</p><p>This is all good, but it feels like the wrong way to go about it. Childhood is depicted by society as an idyllic time that ends at <em>adulthood</em> AKA a job and responsibilities. Most <em>&ldquo;adults&rdquo;</em> are stressed and busy all the time while most children are immersed in the moment and overflowing with spontaneous joy. <em>Who should be learning from whom?</em></p><p>The question I&rsquo;ve been pondering: <strong>Is it possible to be a responsible and well-adjusted adult while maintaining the innate creativity, spontaneity, and joy of a child?</strong> My intuition says yes, and I can think of countless creatives throughout history that have turned their work into play. <strong>What do you think?</strong></p><h2 id=-career-reflections>üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª Career Reflections</h2><p><img src=https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/98f34d2799c1cf5f6a40df4141ffc703d70dc107/images/744a22e5-cb6a-4c6b-8381-a2db81284267.png alt=https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/98f34d2799c1cf5f6a40df4141ffc703d70dc107/images/744a22e5-cb6a-4c6b-8381-a2db81284267.png></p><p>Lol. See y&rsquo;all next month.</p><h2 id=-personal-experiments>ü•ë Personal Experiments</h2><p>My experiment this past month was to use Twitter more. A few days into it, I
<a href=https://twitter.com/nikhilthota/status/1337089520328728577 target=_self rel="noreferrer noopener">realized</a> that the key was to ignore hesitation and post whatever I felt like. I got over my stage fright but ran into another problem&mldr; <em>Twitter is supremely addicting</em>. If I checked it first thing in the morning, I would reflexively open the app every time my focus wavered throughout the day. It has an extraordinary grip on my attention, and I found myself running into my 20 min screen time bumpers constantly. I tried a few things to combat this, and lean towards creation over consumption.</p><ul><li><strong>Draft tweets outside the app</strong>. When I had an idea for a tweet, I would draft it <em>outside</em> of the app so I had clarity to think about it and not get sucked into the ever-enticing feed.</li><li><strong>Turn off push notifications</strong>. This didn&rsquo;t help. I found myself opening the app when bored, salivating for those sweet blue circles.</li><li><strong>Put some &lsquo;Twitter time&rsquo; on your calendar</strong>. I know&mldr; This is very nerdy. However, scheduling 30 minutes daily to read / write tweets really helped build the habit of actually using the app more. Once it became a habit, my &lsquo;Twitter time&rsquo; block got ignored and I was hooked.</li></ul><p>Overall, I&rsquo;ve enjoyed this experiment and will continue to use Twitter. I feel more connected to the ideas of the Twittersphere and have had some cool interactions. One of my favorite writers, Derek Sivers, even replied to a thread I wrote about his book and followed me! ü§Ø</p><p><img src=https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/98f34d2799c1cf5f6a40df4141ffc703d70dc107/images/86094fa7-d16a-4af7-999a-e900460ad403.png alt=https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/98f34d2799c1cf5f6a40df4141ffc703d70dc107/images/86094fa7-d16a-4af7-999a-e900460ad403.png></p><p>In January 2021, I&rsquo;m going to&mldr;
<a href=https://www.bcia.org/files/public/CE%20Articles/36_2biof_summer_buteyko_breathing.pdf target=_self rel="noreferrer noopener">breathe less</a>? I&rsquo;ve been deep in some biomechanical rabbit holes and recently stumbled upon Dr. Konstantin Buteyko. He was a Russian physician who created the Buteyko Method for the treatment of asthma, sleep apnea, and other breathing disorders. It turns out that on average, people breathe 2-3x more than they should, leading to excess oxidative stress. Even people without breathing disorders
<a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/buteyko/ target=_self rel="noreferrer noopener">have reported</a> some remarkable benefits like higher energy levels throughout the day, needing less sleep, etc. when following the Buteyko principles.</p><p>Is all of this just hype / placebo? Maybe. Are there any medical studies that validate these glowing anecdotal reports of increased vitality? Kind of. Am I going to spend this month finding out whether it&rsquo;s legit? Hell yeah! I&rsquo;m a sucker for this stuff. Stay tuned&mldr;</p><h2 id=-best-finds-nectar-of-life>üçØ Best Finds (nectar of life?)</h2><p>üìù

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9ZdL0j8QGA" target=_self rel="noreferrer noopener">dumpster fire</a>, but there have been many things keeping me optimistic with regards to science & technological progress. Here are a few of my favorites to close out this newsletter with.</p><ul><li>For the first time ever, a private company (SpaceX) sent a
<a href=https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/30/spacex-makes-history-with-successful-first-human-space-launch/ target=_self rel="noreferrer noopener">staffed crew</a> into space. With space travel

<a href=https://rameznaam.com/2020/05/14/solars-future-is-insanely-cheap-2020/ target=_self rel="noreferrer noopener">dropping every year</a>. In sunny parts of the world, the cost of solar is now cheaper than that of fossil fuels ‚Äî this means that there will soon be an <em>immediate</em> economic incentive to switch to renewable energy.</li><li>OpenAI unveiled

It allows Biologists to more accurately understand the shapes of proteins. This opens a lot of doors in drug discovery, genetics, and medicine.</li><li>Some scientists injected cells into optic nerves and were able to
<a href=https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03119-1 target=_self rel="noreferrer noopener">reverse ageing</a> in the eyes. This caused optic cells to become younger and restored vision in mice.</li><li>Google also made headlines late last year with its stake on
<a href=https://www.wired.com/story/quantum-computing-here-but-not-really/ target=_self rel="noreferrer noopener">Quantum Supremacy</a> ‚Äî a designation given to a quantum machine that can do something strictly better than a conventional computer. Then, late this year&mldr; China
