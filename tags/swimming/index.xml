I have a&amp;hellip; confession to make. I&amp;rsquo;m an adult that doesn&amp;rsquo;t know how to swim. I spent the majority of my childhood in one of America&amp;rsquo;s wettest states: Florida. As is tradition in the swamp, my parents put me in swim lessons. Though, my 8-year-old self decided that he preferred video games on land and my parents didn&amp;rsquo;t fight it, not knowing how to swim themselves.</description></item></channel></rss>
