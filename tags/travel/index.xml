Our first few days in Kona were standard. We got some morning coffee, I rolled into work at 7am, grinded out some code, and clocked out by 3pm. The evenings were filled with walks, historic sites (more on hawaiian history here), and sunsets by the small beach near our Airbnb known as &amp;ldquo;Keiki Beach Queen&amp;rsquo;s Bath&amp;rdquo;.
By merging the energies of work and life in this way, I&amp;rsquo;ve realized that I genuinely enjoy working on meaningful projects while on vacation.</description></item><item><title>Facing Fears in Big Island</title><link>https://nikhilthota.com/writing/fears/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nikhilthota.com/writing/fears/</guid><description>If you’d like to skip straight to my recommendations, please click here.
A few months ago, I went to Hawaii (again) with Mack during a beautiful interlude in-between jobs. This post is the first in what I hope will become a series of journal entries that dive into my travels. Here are a few goals for this maiden voyage:
First, I want to see if this is useful / enjoyable for myself and my readers (you).</description></item><item><title>2 Months of Solo Travel</title><link>https://nikhilthota.com/writing/2-months-solo-travel/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2019 14:11:15 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://nikhilthota.com/writing/2-months-solo-travel/</guid><description>taipei night market
Travel, like life, is a marathon and not a race — somebody Globalism, smartphones, and balance. These were my topics of musing and reflection during my summer travels. I spent almost 2 months, in between my college graduation at the University of Florida and full-time employment at Facebook, bouncing between Europe and Southeast Asia with just a backpack. This somewhat-solo trip was unlike anything I’d ever done before, and as I’ve settled into a stable groove here in San Francisco, I’d like to unpack some of the personal and more broad-reaching insights I’ve gleaned.</description></item><item><title>Nirvana in Thailand</title><link>https://nikhilthota.com/writing/nirvana-in-thailand/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jul 2019 14:09:11 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://nikhilthota.com/writing/nirvana-in-thailand/</guid><description>Disclaimer: I was going to write this as a satire piece poking fun at the wanderlust travel subculture but after this adventure, I genuinely feel like there’s something for me to explore in writing, so instead I am going to try and earnestly distill my experience into useful substance.
Pai is an interesting place, to say the least. Twenty years ago, the remote village in northern Thailand was nothing more than a small outpost inhabited by a few indigenous groups, sewn together by mountains, rice fields, and the flourishing Pai river.</description></item><item><title>Two Months in a Backpack</title><link>https://nikhilthota.com/writing/two-months-backpack/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Apr 2019 22:11:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://nikhilthota.com/writing/two-months-backpack/</guid><description>This summer, I will be taking the quintessential millennial post-graduation pilgrimage to Southeast Asia for about two months. I wanted to optimize my travel experience as much as possible and this involves traveling with no luggage other than a backpack. I’ve spent a lot of time these past months procrastinating on school responsibilities by planning out this trip and along the way have learned a few things about efficient and intentional travel which I’d like to share.</description></item></channel></rss>
