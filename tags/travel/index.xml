A few months ago, I went to Hawaii (again) with Mack during a beautiful interlude in-between jobs. This post is the first in what I hope will become a series of journal entries that dive into my travels. Here are a few goals for this maiden voyage:
First, I want to see if this is useful / enjoyable for myself and my readers (you).</description></item><item><title>2 Months of Solo Travel</title><link>https://nikhilthota.com/writing/2-months-solo-travel/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2019 14:11:15 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://nikhilthota.com/writing/2-months-solo-travel/</guid><description>taipei night market
Travel, like life, is a marathon and not a race — somebody Globalism, smartphones, and balance. These were my topics of musing and reflection during my summer travels. I spent almost 2 months, in between my college graduation at the University of Florida and full-time employment at Facebook, bouncing between Europe and Southeast Asia with just a backpack.

I wanted to optimize my travel experience as much as possible and this involves traveling with no luggage other than a backpack. I’ve spent a lot of time these past months procrastinating on school responsibilities by planning out this trip and along the way have learned a few things about efficient and intentional travel which I’d like to share.</description></item></channel></rss>
