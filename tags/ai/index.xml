What is this? This is a fun project that I worked on with some folks at Scale&amp;rsquo;s Generative AI hackathon. The intention was to build a lightweight &amp;ldquo;action transformer&amp;rdquo; that could help automate simple and repetitive tasks to the user by leveraging the power of LLMs.
From our official GitHub repo:
Our project is a grounded action transformer that uses language models to decompose complex tasks into simple instructions.</description></item></channel></rss>
