One of the great ironies of life is that when you achieve something you&amp;rsquo;ve been working towards (e.g. get from point A to point B), you often feel empty and restless afterwards. It&amp;rsquo;s partially because of a post-dopamine release of prolactin, and partially because of an assumption that getting to B will solve your problems. The reality is that you ought to find a new B soon, or the lack of self-imposed structure will eat away at you.</description></item></channel></rss>
