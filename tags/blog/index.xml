One study showed that (in middle-aged Finnish men) using the sauna 4-7x a week decreased all-cause mortality by a whopping 40% versus 1x a week.1 If you want the most bang for your buck, the best effective dose of sauna usage (that has been rigorously researched) is 15-20 minutes at 180¬∞F around 4-5 times a week ‚Äî you just want to make sure you get a nice sweat going.</description></item><item><title>The Unsustainable Activity of New York City</title><link>https://nikhilthota.com/writing/unsustainable/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nikhilthota.com/writing/unsustainable/</guid><description>‚ÄúThere is something in the New York air that makes sleep useless.‚Äù

On Visiting NYC Every trip I&amp;rsquo;ve taken to New York City (NYC) has been uniquely memorable. The city is constantly evolving, so it&amp;rsquo;s as if I&amp;rsquo;ve entered a new city, in a new era, on top of my own evolving perspective of the world. Here are a few memorable times:
My first trip in the city involved trouncing through Times Square while I scoured for Grand Central Station to take me to New Haven for a hackathon.</description></item><item><title>Facing Fears in Big Island</title><link>https://nikhilthota.com/writing/fears/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nikhilthota.com/writing/fears/</guid><description>If you‚Äôd like to skip straight to my recommendations, please click here.
A few months ago, I went to Hawaii (again) with Mack during a beautiful interlude in-between jobs. This post is the first in what I hope will become a series of journal entries that dive into my travels. Here are a few goals for this maiden voyage:
First, I want to see if this is useful / enjoyable for myself and my readers (you).</description></item><item><title>On Anime and Manga „Ç¢„Éã„É°</title><link>https://nikhilthota.com/writing/anime/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nikhilthota.com/writing/anime/</guid><description>If you&amp;rsquo;d like to skip to a tl;dr on what to know when trying to start watching anime, click here.
I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed a trend with people that enjoy anime. Outside of the more passionate outliers, fans tend to underplay or even omit their love for the genre until someone else brings it up. With these people, conversations go somewhat like this:

Hey everyone. Before we get into this, I am not a medical professional (sorry dad). Everything that I&amp;rsquo;ve written here is based on personal experience and publicly available information. If you&amp;rsquo;re considering doing an extended fast, do your own research. ‚úåüèΩ
A couple of months ago, my marathon-running-roommate Kenton convinced me, my other roommate Tyler, and my girlfriend Mack to attempt a 72 hour fast with him. I&amp;rsquo;d been curious about fasting for a while but wanted to start with 24 hours and eventually work my way up to a full three days.</description></item><item><title>Multimodal Reading</title><link>https://nikhilthota.com/writing/multimodal-reading/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nikhilthota.com/writing/multimodal-reading/</guid><description>Books are incredible. They&amp;rsquo;re even better when you can get them for free. However, one thing that I struggle with is figuring out what to read with the vast quantity of options available. One thing that has helped me is segmenting my reading into buckets based on the medium of consumption.
What does that mean? Today, there are more ways to read a book than to just buy a physical tome and read it cover-to-cover.</description></item><item><title>The Sun and The Clouds</title><link>https://nikhilthota.com/writing/sun-and-clouds/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nikhilthota.com/writing/sun-and-clouds/</guid><description>Imagine that we live where it&amp;#39;s always cloudy. We never see the sun. And we, of course, take our everyday experience as if it&amp;#39;s reality‚Äîthe only reality. The clouds are perhaps a little claustrophobic in some vague way but they&amp;#39;re comfortable and familiar. One day we meet a visitor who tells us that what we&amp;#39;re used to isn&amp;#39;t the whole story, that there&amp;#39;s something else. Curious, we go with him, and he guides us up a mountain.</description></item><item><title>Musings on Avatar and War</title><link>https://nikhilthota.com/writing/avatar/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nikhilthota.com/writing/avatar/</guid><description>Growing up we were taught that the Fire Nation was the greatest civilization in history. And somehow the war was our way of sharing our greatness with the rest of the world. What an amazing lie that was. The people of the world are terrified by the Fire Nation. They don&amp;#39;t see our greatness ‚Äî They hate us! And we deserve it.

August 21st, 2019 was an interesting day for me. It was an average wednesday, except that I had just gotten an audiobook copy of When Breath Becomes Air by Paul Kalanithi. Being the 2x playback speed fiend that I am, I made it to the end in a couple of days and found myself tearing up in the gym in between sets of incline bench press.</description></item><item><title>The Untethered Soul</title><link>https://nikhilthota.com/writing/untethered-soul/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Apr 2020 23:50:08 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://nikhilthota.com/writing/untethered-soul/</guid><description>15808 NW 90th Street, Alachua, Florida, 32615 ‚Äî The Temple of the Universe
Nested in the thicket of North Florida&amp;rsquo;s wilderness, about a 30 minute drive from the University of Florida, is the Temple of the Universe. The temple is a spiritual sanctuary where &amp;lsquo;men and women of any religion or set of beliefs can come together to experience the love, peace, and bliss which exists within all beings.&amp;rsquo; The temple was set up by Michael ‚ÄúMicky‚Äù Singer, an ex-entrepreneur who started a company that was acquired by WebMD for over $5 billion to focus fully on writing and spirituality.</description></item><item><title>Disjointed Fellowship Fragments</title><link>https://nikhilthota.com/writing/interact/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Mar 2020 23:50:08 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://nikhilthota.com/writing/interact/</guid><description>A few months ago, I applied to the Interact Fellowship, but unfortunately got rejected shortly after. The application essays however, were incredibly insightful and posed a lot of interesting questions that I found myself thinking a lot about. I wanted to share my ramblings for some of these questions because I think that they tell a lot about who I am as a person. Shoutout to Kenton for the idea.</description></item><item><title>On Frugality and Flourishing</title><link>https://nikhilthota.com/writing/frugality-flourishing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2020 14:15:15 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://nikhilthota.com/writing/frugality-flourishing/</guid><description>It‚Äôs February, and I have a yearning to finally finish this piece. I‚Äôve been putting it off for so long, but it‚Äôs time that I actually attempt to press some keys and create some prose. This is a topic I feel is especially relevant these days as I‚Äôve been having interesting conversations and thoughts about money and the value of frugality. If my first several months into the world of true financial independence as a fully fledged ‚Äòadult‚Äô is any signal, I am¬†obsessed¬†with saving money.</description></item><item><title>From Hacker to...

As a former organizer of the event during my stint as a student, I was left feeling both humility and pride, seeing how far SwampHacks has come. During the early years of the event, we were lucky to have 200 attendees and had to basically beg sponsors to recognize the event as legitimate.</description></item><item><title>The Philosophy of a Dairy Pill</title><link>https://nikhilthota.com/writing/dairy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Dec 2019 14:14:15 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://nikhilthota.com/writing/dairy/</guid><description>Lactose Intolerance [¬†lak-tohs in-tol-er-uh ns ] /¬†noun¬†‚Äî a digestive disorder caused by the inability to digest lactose, a main carbohydrate in dairy products, which can lead to a¬†negative effect on quality of life.

Travel, like life, is a marathon and not a race ‚Äî somebody Globalism, smartphones, and balance. These were my topics of musing and reflection during my summer travels. I spent almost¬†2 months,¬†in between my college graduation at the University of Florida and full-time employment at Facebook, bouncing between Europe and Southeast Asia with just a backpack. This somewhat-solo trip was unlike anything I‚Äôd ever done before, and as I‚Äôve settled into a stable groove here in San Francisco, I‚Äôd like to unpack some of the personal¬†and¬†more broad-reaching insights I‚Äôve gleaned.</description></item><item><title>Nirvana in Thailand</title><link>https://nikhilthota.com/writing/nirvana-in-thailand/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jul 2019 14:09:11 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://nikhilthota.com/writing/nirvana-in-thailand/</guid><description>Disclaimer: I was going to write this as a satire piece poking fun at the wanderlust travel subculture but after this adventure, I genuinely feel like there‚Äôs something for me to explore in writing, so instead I am going to try and earnestly distill my experience into useful substance.
Pai is an¬†interesting¬†place, to say the least. Twenty years ago, the remote village in northern Thailand was nothing more than a small outpost inhabited by a few indigenous groups, sewn together by mountains, rice fields, and the flourishing Pai river.</description></item><item><title>Two Months in a Backpack</title><link>https://nikhilthota.com/writing/two-months-backpack/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Apr 2019 22:11:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://nikhilthota.com/writing/two-months-backpack/</guid><description>This summer, I will be taking the quintessential millennial post-graduation pilgrimage to Southeast Asia for about two months. I wanted to optimize my travel experience as much as possible and this involves traveling with no luggage other than a backpack. I‚Äôve spent a lot of time these past months procrastinating on school responsibilities by planning out this trip and along the way have learned a few things about efficient and intentional travel which I‚Äôd like to share.</description></item><item><title>Digital Minimalism</title><link>https://nikhilthota.com/writing/digital-minimalism/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Feb 2019 18:11:01 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://nikhilthota.com/writing/digital-minimalism/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
