What is this? This is a fun project that I worked on with some folks at Scale&amp;rsquo;s Generative AI hackathon. The intention was to build a lightweight &amp;ldquo;action transformer&amp;rdquo; that could help automate simple and repetitive tasks to the user by leveraging the power of LLMs.
From our official GitHub repo:
Our project is a grounded action transformer that uses language models to decompose complex tasks into simple instructions.</description></item><item><title>Texts.com</title><link>https://nikhilthota.com/projects/texts/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nikhilthota.com/projects/texts/</guid><description>&amp;hellip;</description></item><item><title>Cheez</title><link>https://nikhilthota.com/projects/cheez/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nikhilthota.com/projects/cheez/</guid><description>&amp;hellip;</description></item><item><title>Hive Explorer</title><link>https://nikhilthota.com/projects/hive/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nikhilthota.com/projects/hive/</guid><description>&amp;hellip;</description></item><item><title>Stream of Thots</title><link>https://nikhilthota.com/projects/stream/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nikhilthota.com/projects/stream/</guid><description>&amp;hellip;</description></item><item><title>Digital Garden &amp; Second Brain</title><link>https://nikhilthota.com/projects/brain/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nikhilthota.com/projects/brain/</guid><description>&amp;hellip;</description></item><item><title>Exploring My Mind With Python</title><link>https://nikhilthota.com/projects/python-mind-exploration/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 May 2019 22:11:22 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://nikhilthota.com/projects/python-mind-exploration/</guid><description>A few months ago at a random Chinatown bar in New York City, Tyler Richards and I were having a conversation about journaling. I told him that I had over 4 years worth of consistent journal entries and Tyler, being the data-minded person he is, gave me an idea to reinforce the lessons and insights from these journaling sessions.
The Idea: A system that emails me a random journal entry every day so I could see exactly what was going on in my mind at that given time.</description></item><item><title>Tuna Pasta</title><link>https://nikhilthota.com/projects/tuna-pasta/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nikhilthota.com/projects/tuna-pasta/</guid><description>&amp;hellip;</description></item></channel></rss>
