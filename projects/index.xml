What is this? This is a fun project that I worked on with some folks at Scale&amp;rsquo;s Generative AI hackathon. The intention was to build a lightweight &amp;ldquo;action transformer&amp;rdquo; that could help automate simple and repetitive tasks to the user by leveraging the power of LLMs.
From our official GitHub repo:
Our project is a grounded action transformer that uses language models to decompose complex tasks into simple instructions.</description></item><item><title>Building a Memex</title><link>https://nikhilthota.com/projects/memex/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nikhilthota.com/projects/memex/</guid><description>This was originally posted on my newsletter.
A few weeks ago I came across this tweet from Linus, better known as @thesephist:

This is a fun project that I&amp;rsquo;m working on to ramp up on Web3 development. It&amp;rsquo;s essentially a website where people can &amp;ldquo;wave&amp;rdquo; at me and have these waves recorded on the blockchain (specifically the Rinkeby Eth testnet). This is based on a project from Buildspace.
As this was my first Web3 project, there were a lot of learnings along the way ‚Äî¬†here&amp;rsquo;s a rough order of how things got to the way they are:</description></item><item><title>Marketplace Safety Tools</title><link>https://nikhilthota.com/projects/meeting-plans/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nikhilthota.com/projects/meeting-plans/</guid><description>What is this? This was a project that I was involved in during my days at Meta Facebook Marketplace. One of the biggest problems we were facing Marketplace was the safety of its users. There were some robberies, scams, and even deaths, and so we started brainstorming ways to mitigate this.
One of the solutions was to create a suite of safety products while transcating on Marketplace, including sharable meetup plans, a safety check-in, live location sharing, and other tools.</description></item><item><title>Exploring My Mind With Python</title><link>https://nikhilthota.com/projects/python-mind-exploration/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 May 2019 22:11:22 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://nikhilthota.com/projects/python-mind-exploration/</guid><description>A few months ago at a random Chinatown bar in New York City, Tyler Richards¬†and I were having a conversation about journaling. I told him that I had over 4¬†years¬†worth of consistent journal entries and Tyler, being the data-minded person he is, gave me an idea to reinforce the lessons and insights from these journaling sessions.
The Idea: A system that emails me a random journal entry every day so I could see exactly what was going on in my mind at that given time.</description></item><item><title>Tuna Pasta</title><link>https://nikhilthota.com/projects/tuna-pasta/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nikhilthota.com/projects/tuna-pasta/</guid><description>&amp;hellip;</description></item></channel></rss>
