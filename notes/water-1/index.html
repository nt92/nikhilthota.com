<a href=https://tinyletter.com/nikhilthota/letters/s02-e04-aquatic-confessions target=_self rel="noreferrer noopener">This was originally posted on my newsletter.</a></p>
<p>I have a&mldr; confession to make. <em>I&rsquo;m an adult that doesn&rsquo;t know how to swim.</em> I spent the majority of my childhood in one of America&rsquo;s wettest states: Florida. As is tradition in the swamp, my parents put me in swim lessons. Though, my 8-year-old self decided that he preferred video games on land and my parents didn&rsquo;t fight it, not knowing how to swim themselves. If only they knew the depths of fear & fomo that this decision would instill within me.The following is an account of my swimming journey up until now.</p>
<p>Throughout middle & high school, I avoided friend&rsquo;s houses with pools, social outings at the beach, and water parks like the plague. It wasn&rsquo;t until college that I decided to dip my toes in and recruited a friend of mine who was on the swim team to teach me how to swim. That old Aristotle quote rang true in this case — knowing how to swim ≠ being able to teach it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;Those that know do, those that understand teach."</em></p>
<p>— Aristotle, probably</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I kept at it and eventually learned how to freestyle in the shallow end of the pool for ~25m thanks to YouTube and a healthy glob of anxiety. I learned how to use the kickboard and bought myself a dapper pair of goggles (and a pair of speedos, before promptly returning it once my 25m-freestyle-high wore off). The summer after my sophomore year of college, I interned in South Florida, just 15 minutes from Miami. I had decided that enough was enough and scoured the local area to find a swim instructor.</p>
<p>None of the instructors I found had much experience with adults because for someone growing up in Florida, learning to swim is synonymous to learning to walk. Eventually I found someone that seemed friendly and open to teaching someone over the age of 8. I went to the local YMCA twice a week to flounder in the pool and she attempted to teach me the basic strokes & how to tread water. After a month of this, I felt much more comfortable and added lap swimming to my comfortable repertoire of exercise.</p>
<p>My internship ended and I felt much more confident in a pool, assuming I could touch the floor. Unfortunately, the confidence to swim in the ocean or dive into the deep end still eluded me. After this promising start, my swimming growth took a backseat to school and the internship hunt. A few more summers of missed opportunities in the Pacific Ocean and Lake Tahoe flew by, and I gave it another shot and signed up for adult swimming lessons at my University during my final semester.</p>
<p>It was comforting (minor
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schadenfreude? target=_self rel="noreferrer noopener">schadenfreude</a> to see grad students and professors that were far more fearful of water than I was — one even struggled to dip his toes into the water. I remember what it felt like to be in that position, and I feel for him and respected his tenacity as a tenured professor with glittering accolades that should have it <em>&ldquo;figured out&rdquo;</em>. Unfortunately, the lessons weren&rsquo;t that great and yet again, I learned that an excellent swimmer does not make for an excellent swim instructor.</p>
<p>I continued to practice and pushed my boundaries whenever I could, occasionally venturing into the deep end and practicing my treading. My school had a program at a nearby lake (Lake Wauberg) that gave you a sailing certification after a few classes. The only caveat was that you had to be able to swim 50m in open water and tread for at least 3 minutes. I made it close to this amount but alas, was swept away from my practice yet again by the demands & vibes of the semester.</p>

<p>Since then, I&rsquo;ve managed to jump into Vietnam&rsquo;s Ha Long Bay (albeit with a life jacket on) and
<a href=https://tinyletter.com/nikhilthota/letters/s01-e03-the-sandwich-islands target=_self rel="noreferrer noopener">surf in Hawaii</a>. Though, Covid-19 had other plans and the public pools of the world closed down for about 1.5 years. Things are opening up, and I&rsquo;m swimming again at the pool in my local Crunch Fitness. It&rsquo;s a slow & steady process but between tread-offs with Mack in the Scottsdale public pool to learning how to breast-stroke at Crypto mansion parties, I&rsquo;m getting there. <strong>More importantly, I&rsquo;m realizing that learning to swim as an adult doesn&rsquo;t have to be scary — it can even be fun.</strong> I have a feeling that this is the last summer that I&rsquo;ll be a landlubber.</p>
<p>Why does any of this matter? I thought that I was an anomaly (and maybe I am as far as Floridians are concerned) but it turns out that
<a href=https://www.redcross.org/about-us/news-and-events/press-release/red-cross-launches-campaign-to-cut-drowning-in-half-in-50-cities.html target=_self rel="noreferrer noopener">> 50% of Americans say they cannot properly swim</a>. That&rsquo;s an insane metric, and considering how nourishing the water can be, too many people are missing out on the healing that time spent in water can bring. I hope to learn how to swim confidently as an adult and document my experience along the way for anyone else that struggles with this. It&rsquo;s possible, and I will show you the way.</p>
<p>From Melon Dash, the creator of the
<a href=https://miracleswimming.com/ target=_self rel="noreferrer noopener">Miracle Swimming</a> School for Adults:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&mldr;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Panic doesn&rsquo;t happen in my class,&rdquo; Dash said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;because I start by saying &lsquo;Your job is to have fun.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s not that they need to learn how to tread water, they need to learn how to be here."*</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here are the skills & milestones that I am focusing on:</p>
<ol>
<li>Learn all of the major strokes (freestyle, breaststroke, backstroke, butterfly)</li>
<li>Master the breath control necessary to be effective</li>
<li>Be able to tread water indefinitely</li>
<li>Swim comfortably into deep water and feel at peace</li>
<li>Venture into open water — waves, sea critters, and all</li>
</ol>
<p>Above all, I think Mary Roach from the New York Times Play Magazine
<a href=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/02/sports/playmagazine/02play-mytribe.html target=_self rel="noreferrer noopener">sums it up best</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;&mldr; I don’t care about form. All I want is to be one of the people who can jump gleefully into deep water and remain there, splashing and laughing.&rdquo;</p>
